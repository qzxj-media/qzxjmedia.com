And so it begins! Back in the earlier part of 2022, I decided I wanted to build a game
that combined some of my favorite elements: turn-based tactics a la _Advance Wars_ and
_Fire Emblem_, and roguelike progression and replayability like _Slay the Spire_.

I am not a good artist, so I was lucky enough to have my friend Ender join me as an artist
and collaborator in creating this game. Look out for future posts related to game art by him!

We hope that keeping this devlog will not only help motivate us in our progress,
but also inspire any other aspirational game developers out there. I want this devlog
to be a place where we can keep track of our ideas and growth but also share our learnings
along the way. There is much more to say about the game and its development progress, and
I hope to write more about the software engineering and data architecture of the game in the future.
